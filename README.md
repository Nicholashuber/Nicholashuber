## 💼 About Me

I'm a lead software engineer, AI consultant, and founder of [Niche.dev](https://niche.dev) — an AI integration agency helping businesses unlock the full power of automation, natural language processing, and intelligent workflows.

With over a decade of hands-on experience, I specialize in building high-impact systems for business development, onboarding, and internal tools — especially in the Salesforce ecosystem and beyond.

I believe great software solves real problems and empowers people. I build fast, think big, and ship smart.

- 📈 **Business Productivity Tools**  
  Creator of **BD Mobile** – a Salesforce-like mobile app designed for field reps to operate at peak performance.

- 💡 **SaaS Projects**  
  Building products that help businesses onboard, train, and communicate faster — like automated HR portals and real-time AI roleplay trainers.

- 🤖 **Developer Mentorship & Tools**

## 🧭 Philosophy

> *"A senior dev should solve any problem, not just the one assigned."*

I live by this. I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves, dig into new tech, or lead teams through complexity. I care about clarity, autonomy, and momentum. Great code should *move the business*.
